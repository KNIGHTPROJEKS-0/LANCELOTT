# Project Organization Complete

## Overview

The LANCELOTT project has been completely organized according to the established canonical rules and best practices. All files are now in their proper locations, dependencies have been consolidated, and references have been updated.

## Completed Organization Tasks

### 1. Script and Test Organization ✅

**Scripts moved to `/scripts/`:**

- `dataconnect.sh` → `scripts/dataconnect.sh`
- `deploy_firebase.sh` → `scripts/deploy_firebase.sh`
- `deploy_firebase_auth.sh` → `scripts/deploy_firebase_auth.sh`
- `functions.sh` → `scripts/functions.sh`
- `quick_setup.sh` → `scripts/quick_setup.sh`
- `setup_github_repository.sh` → `scripts/setup_github_repository.sh`
- `deploy.py` → `scripts/deploy.py`

**Tests moved to `/tests/`:**

- `test_firebase_auth_basic.py` → `tests/test_firebase_auth_basic.py`
- `integrations/tools/test_integrations.py` → `tests/integration/test_integrations.py`
- `scripts/utils/test_system.py` → `tests/unit/test_system.py`

### 2. Requirements Consolidation ✅

**Single requirements.txt file:**

- Consolidated all dependencies from `functions/requirements.txt` into main `requirements.txt`
- Added Firebase Cloud Functions specific dependencies:
  - `firebase-functions>=0.1.0`
  - `flask>=2.3.0`
  - `flask-cors>=4.0.0`
  - `sentry-sdk>=1.38.0`
  - `asyncio-mqtt>=0.11.0`
- Removed redundant `functions/requirements.txt`
- Updated Firebase configuration to use consolidated requirements

### 3. Documentation Organization ✅

**Documentation structure:**

- All documentation properly organized in `/docs/` directory
- INDEX.md maintained and current
- Documentation structure follows canonical pattern
- Tool-specific documentation remains in respective tool directories

### 4. Firebase Configuration Updates ✅

**Updated configurations:**

- `firebase.json` - Updated to use consolidated `requirements.txt`
- `dataconnect.yaml` - Validated and confirmed proper structure
- Data Connect connectors validated and confirmed present

### 5. Reference Updates ✅

**Updated file references:**

- README.md - Updated script paths from `./` to `scripts/`
- status/monitoring/status.py - Updated quick_setup.sh path
- tests/integration/test_simple_integration.py - Updated script references
- tests/unit/test_supertools.py - Updated script references
- scripts/setup_github_repository.sh - Updated deploy script references

## Project Root Compliance

### Allowed Files at Root ✅

The project root now contains only the permitted files according to the canonical rules:

**Configuration Files:**

- `.env`, `.env.example`, `.envrc`
- `.firebaserc`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`
- `.zshrc_lancelott`

**Core Application Files:**

- `app.py`, `lancelott.py`, `main.py`, `server.py`, `start.py`
- `crush_orchestrator.py`, `validate_project.py`

**Build and Deployment:**

- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`
- `project.json`, `requirements.txt`

**Firebase Configuration:**

- `dataconnect.rules`, `dataconnect.yaml`
- `firebase.json`, `firestore.indexes.json`, `firestore.rules`
- `functions.rules`, `storage.rules`

**Other Permitted Files:**

- `README.md`, `pyarmor.bug.log`, `crush`
- `firebase-debug.log`

### Removed from Root ✅

All non-permitted files have been moved to their canonical locations:

- Scripts moved to `/scripts/`
- Tests moved to `/tests/`
- No unauthorized files remain at root
