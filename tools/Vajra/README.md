## About Vajra

Vajra is a UI based tool with multiple techniques for attacking and enumerating in target's Azure environment. 

The term Vajra refers to the Weapon of God Indra in Indian mythology (God of Thunder &amp; Storms). Its connection to the cloud makes it a perfect name for the tool.

Vajra presently supports Azure and AWS Cloud environments, with plans to add support for Google Cloud Platform and certain OSINT in the future.

## üìñ User Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Initial Access**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:9847` after installation
   - Use default credentials to log in (change immediately after first login)

2. **Security Recommendations**
   - Change default admin password immediately
   - Enable IP restrictions if running in production
   - Consider using HTTPS (configuration available in app.py)

3. **Target Configuration**
   - Configure your Azure/AWS credentials in the application
   - Set up proper permissions for enumeration and testing
   - Review target scope and permissions before starting tests

### üîß Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
- If port 9847 is occupied, modify the port in `Code/app.py`
- Choose a unique port number (e.g., 9848, 8765, etc.)

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure proper file permissions on the Vajra directory
- Run with appropriate user privileges
- Check virtual environment activation

**Database Issues**
- SQLite database is created automatically in `vajra/site.db`
- Delete the database file to reset (will lose all data)
- Ensure write permissions in the vajra directory

**Module Import Errors**
- Verify virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Use in Authorized Environments Only**: Only test on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Network Security**: Consider firewall rules and network segmentation
- **Credential Management**: Store credentials securely, avoid hardcoding
- **Logging**: Monitor application logs for security events
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches

### üéØ Best Practices

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define clear testing scope and objectives
   - Obtain proper authorization before testing
   - Document expected vs actual results

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Start with enumeration before attempting attacks
   - Monitor for detection and response
   - Keep detailed logs of activities

3. **Reporting Phase**
   - Document all findings with evidence
   - Provide clear remediation recommendations
   - Follow responsible disclosure practices

3. **Reconnaissance**: Master enumeration techniques before attacks
4. **Attack Methodology**: Follow a structured approach to testing
5. **Documentation**: Always document findings and create reports

## üö® Important Recommendations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Use
- **Authorization Required**: Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities responsibly to affected organizations
- **Compliance**: Ensure testing complies with local laws and regulations
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs for accountability and reporting

### üîí Security Best Practices
- **Isolated Environment**: Run Vajra in isolated/sandboxed environments when possible

- **Network Segmentation**: Use proper network controls and monitoring
- **Regular Updates**: Keep Vajra and dependencies updated for security patches

### üéØ Effective Testing Tips
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define testing scope and boundaries
- **Incremental Approach**: Start with passive reconnaissance, then active testing
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays to avoid triggering security controls
- **Evidence Collection**: Screenshot and document all findings thoroughly

### üöÄ Performance Optimization
- **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources during large scans
- **Concurrent Operations**: Limit concurrent threads based on target capacity
- **Result Storage**: Regularly export and backup test results
- **Clean Environment**: Use fresh virtual environments for different engagements
