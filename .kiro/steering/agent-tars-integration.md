# Agent-Tars Integration Guide for LANCELOTT

This document provides comprehensive guidance on integrating [Agent-Tars](https://agent-tars.com/) with the LANCELOTT framework and its related tools. It consolidates official best practices and contextual adaptations for project-wide, reproducible deployments.

---

## Overview

**Agent-Tars** is a modular, extensible AI agent orchestration platform. Integrating Agent-Tars enables automated workflows, intelligent command execution, browser automation, and seamless workspace management within LANCELOTT.

---

## 1. Introduction

- **Reference:** [Agent-Tars Introduction](https://agent-tars.com/guide/get-started/introduction.html)
- Agent-Tars streamlines agent management, task automation, and intelligent orchestration.
- Ensure all team members are familiar with core Agent-Tars concepts before integration.

---

## 2. Quick Start

- **Reference:** [Quick Start Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/get-started/quick-start.html)
- Install Agent-Tars in your preferred Python environment:

  ```bash
  pip install agent-tars
  ```

- Initialize a new workspace for LANCELOTT:

  ```bash
  tars init --workspace lancellott
  ```

- Verify CLI functionality:

  ```bash
  tars --help
  ```

---

## 3. Command Line Interface (CLI) Usage

- **Reference:** [CLI Documentation](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/cli.html)
- Most integrations and automations will begin with CLI commands.
- Example for running a specific agent:

  ```bash
  tars agent run <agent_name>
  ```

- Use CLI to manage agents, workspaces, configurations, and logs.

---

## 4. Web UI Integration

- **Reference:** [Web UI Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/web-ui.html)
- Start the Web UI:

  ```bash
  tars ui
  ```

- Use the Web UI for visual management of agents, workflow orchestration, and monitoring.

---

## 5. Workspace Management

- **Reference:** [Workspace Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/workspace.html)
- Each project (including LANCELOTT) should have a dedicated Agent-Tars workspace.
- Store workspace config and data under `/tools/agent-tars/` or another designated directory.
- Sync workspace settings with project requirements for environment reproducibility.

---

## 6. Configuration

- **Reference:** [Configuration Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/config.html)
- All agent configurations (`config.yaml`, `.env`, etc.) must be committed to version control, except secrets.
- Store sensitive values in encrypted secrets management systems; do not commit API keys or credentials.
- Example config snippet:

  ```yaml
  workspace: lancellott
  agents:
    - name: my_agent
      script: ./tools/agent-tars/agents/my_agent.py
  ```

---

## 7. Browser Automation

- **Reference:** [Browser Integration](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/browser.html)
- Enable browser automation for tasks requiring web interaction.
- Configure browser options (`headless`, `proxy`, etc.) in the agent or workspace config.
- Example:

  ```yaml
  browser:
    enabled: true
    headless: true
  ```

---

## 8. Command Management

- **Reference:** [Command Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/command.html)
- Integrate custom commands for LANCELOTT tools by registering them in the Agent-Tars workspace.
- Place command scripts in `/tools/agent-tars/commands/` and expose via CLI or UI.

---

## 9. Multi-Component Protocol (MCP)

- **Reference:** [MCP Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/mcp.html)
- Use MCP to coordinate actions between multiple agents and LANCELOTT submodules.
- Ensure all agents adhere to the same protocol version for compatibility.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **Reference:** [Troubleshooting Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/basic/troubleshooting.html)
- Document all integration issues and fixes in `/docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- Use verbose logging and Agent-Tars diagnostic tools to resolve errors quickly.

---

## 11. Advanced Server Deployment

- **Reference:** [Server Guide](https://agent-tars.com/guide/advanced/server.html)
- For production, deploy Agent-Tars as a server to orchestrate agents across distributed environments.
- Secure server endpoints and restrict API access as per LANCELOTT security policies.

---
